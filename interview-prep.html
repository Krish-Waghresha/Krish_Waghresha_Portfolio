    <p> <span class="interview-titles">The Beginning:</span> So, I had this idea to create something helpful for those prepping for tech interviews. I wanted it to cover C, Java, and OOP because, well, those are the hot topics, right?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phase 1: Collecting the Goods First up, I went on a quest for questions. I scoured forums, websites, you name it, and ended up with a sweet collection of 130 questions, sorted by how tough they were.</p>
</li>
   <li> <p>Phase 2: Figuring Out the Tech Stuff Now, I'm no expert, but I wanted to understand how things like cookies, sessions, and JSP work. Let's just say, it was a bit of a rollercoaster ride! But hey, trial and error is how we learn, right?</p>
   </li>
<li>   
<p>Phase 3: Making It Look Good I'm no designer either, but I wanted this thing to look snazzy. So, I tinkered with the UI, played around with CSS, and bam! InterviewPrep got a makeover.

</ul>

<p>
<span class="interview-titles">What I Learned:</span>
<ol>
<li>Got the hang of cookies and sessions, finally!</li>
<li>Figured out how to build a database without losing my mind.</li>
<li>CSS transitions? Nailed it.</li>
<li>Became a pro at juggling HTML, CSS, Java, and Postgres all at once.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>   
    <span class="interview-titles">What's Next:</span> <br>
        <ul>Version 2 is on the horizon!</ul>  
<li>Less reliance on cookies</li> <li>smarter database use</li> <li>some cool new features like easy question navigation.</li>
